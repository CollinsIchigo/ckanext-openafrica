<p>The Open Africa Platform initiative aims to be largest repository of Data on the Africa Continent. We are creating a Library of Congress of Data for African for use by Citizens, Media, Activists, Governments and Civil Society. The Platform will also provide structured linked data with a robust API (Application Programming Interface) that will allow Developers to build applications. The Platform will have a rating system that will rate uploaded Datasets according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html" target="_blank">5 star deployment scheme</a> for Open Data.</p>
